# Ransomware Alert!

Ransomware is no joke – follow IT security procedures to keep your data safe.

Beware of ransomware threats and how they can come through phishing emails – they are a serious threat that can disrupt your life and impact everyone at the polytechnic. 

**Tip:** Inconsistent language, unprofessional layouts, spelling mistakes, invasive software install demands and an artificial sense of urgency scream “phishing scam!”
