# What is a Phish?

Phishing emails can look real but don’t be fooled! 

They are often disguised as legitimate messages from trusted sources but aim to trick you into divulging sensitive information.

**Tip:** Inconsistent language, unprofessional layouts, spelling mistakes, and an artificial sense of urgency scream “phishing scam!”
