# What is MFA?

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring multiple forms of verification. This ensures that only you can access your account, even if someone else knows your password.

**Tip:** Verify itâ€™s YOU before approving MFA requests by checking that the location matches your current whereabouts! And of course, keep your MFA under wraps to dodge any sneaky intruders!
