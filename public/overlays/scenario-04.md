# What is MFA?

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring multiple forms of verification. This ensures that only you can access your account, even if someone else knows your password.

**What to look out for:** Always make sure you're the one responding to MFA requests! Use trusted devices and avoid sharing your MFA methods with others.
